For details on the parameters and allowed values for Criteria please visit the documentation http://developer.beanstream.com/documentation/analyze-payments/search-specific-criteria/

*Tags:* `Reporting`

### Tokenize credit card

> NOTE that the full URL for this API call is https://www.beanstream.com/scripts/tokenization/tokens. Turn a credit card into a token using this service. This helps lessen your PCI scope by not passing the credit card information to your server. Instead you turn the card number into a token in the client app, then send the token to the server. When you send the token to Beanstream to make a payment, Beanstream then looks up the card number from that token and makes the payment. Tokens can also be used to create payment profiles.
